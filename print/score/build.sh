# THE PRINT SCORE, END TO END — the answer to "how do I re-render after I change
# the score?" (composer, day 37).
#
# THE CHAIN, and the step that is easy to miss:
#
#     scores/<save>.json  --(notate_section)-->  notation/ir/db1.ir.json  --(export_print)-->  PDF
#                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#     The print score is drawn from the IR, NOT from the save file. Edit the
#     score, re-run export_print alone, and you render the OLD notation with no
#     error of any kind. That is why --rebuild-ir exists.
#
#   bash print/score/build.sh                 # render the PDF from the IR as it stands
#   bash print/score/build.sh --rebuild-ir    # rebuild the IR from the score FIRST, then render
#
# The IR rebuild uses the IR's OWN recorded build command (`provenance.build`),
# which is the method the journal's tool table specifies — so it cannot drift
# from how the page was actually made.
#
# Density, margins, colour: pass through, e.g.
#   bash print/score/build.sh --sec 15
#   bash print/score/build.sh --margin 0.4
