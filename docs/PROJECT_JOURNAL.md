## §1 Quick-Start

- **The piece:** flute (piccolo, bass flute) · bass clarinet · piano · vn 1 · vn 2 · va · vc,
  for the TEMPUS LAB 2026 call (`docs/Tempus-Lab2026_Application_English.pdf`).
  Deadline **2026-10-15 23:59 CET** · max **12 min** · PDF score ≤ **DIN A3** · fee €25 ·
  concerts 26–28 Nov 2026, Leipzig · if selected, score + parts due 4 weeks before.
- **The stack:** piece #4's, copied forward, palette rewritten (D1). Composer score `:5300`,
  sandbox `:4800`. Same delivery format as the tuba piece: animated score; presentation
  score (video + print) for the submission; performance score ported from #4 later (D2, D3).
- **Phases (D3):** 0 setup → 1 compose (sample libraries + composer score) → 2 notate
  (2a engine adaptation · 2b presentation score) → 3 performance versions → 4 submission.
- **Reference repos** (read-only, additional working dirs): #4 tubas · #3 bcha · #2 2p2p ·
  #1 sq1 · `live-electronics-engine` (its journaling practice only — no electronics, no
  code from it in this piece; composer 2026-09-03). Consult per named question only.
- **The IR contract (D9):** the composer save is the ground truth; the IR is derived from
  it by the extractor and is the single source for the animated score, video, print and
  stands. Composing never waits on it.
- **Apps (0b, live since 2026-09-03):** `node score/server.js` → http://localhost:5300/
  composer.html · `node sandbox/serve.js` → http://localhost:4800 · `.claude/launch.json`
  names them `score` / `sandbox`. `scores/septet.json` = the committed day-one stub; the
  piece goes in the `piece-sNN` chain (#4's NAMING.md). Recipes: `sandbox/instruments.js`
  (provisional until 0e/0c).

### Map of piece #4 (survey 2026-09-03) — what the port inherits

- **Composer score app** `score/` — zero-dependency Node server (`server.js`, 54 KB) +
  `public/composer.html` (810 KB) + panels: `compiler.js` (meta-curve → swell schedules,
  Roads grain envelopes), `morph*.js`, `texture_*.js`, `pulse_seq*.js`, `multitempo*.js`,
  `tonality.js`, `sonify_core.js`, `clusterview.html`, `chordview.html`, `planner.html`.
  Tracks are **instrument-keyed** (`tracks: {tuba1..tuba10}`, `{id,label,instKey}`); the
  META drawing lane is `META_LAYER = 10`. Tuba coupling: the `TRACKS` array, ten lane
  labels + a `<select>`, two `INSTRUMENTS.tuba1` lookups, one `'tuba' + (10 - k)` port
  spot, `layoutVersion` migration code. **Storage is two object types** (`waveCurve`,
  `marker`); the piece is the `piece-sNN` save chain (`docs/SAVE_FILES.md`, `NAMING.md`).
- **Server routes** the app needs: `/api/composer/*` (save/load/list/versions/discard/
  palette/mtime), `/api/motives*`, `/api/snapshots`, `/api/taxonomy`, `/api/clusterbank`,
  `/api/actuals*`, `/api/morph*`, `/api/texture*`, `/api/pulsepalette`, `/api/shapepresets`,
  `/api/generate-ostinato`, `/api/notation/renders`; static `/docs/`, `/bank/`, `/notation/`,
  `/probes/`. Requires only `./snapshots.js` and `../tools/model_bank.js` (which requires
  `score/public/morph.js`). Reads `bank/*.json` at request time — **empty valid skeletons
  needed** for cluster_bank, blast_taxonomy, actuals, or the panels 404.
- **Sandbox** `sandbox/` — `serve.js` (3 KB), `index.html` (25 KB), `instruments.js` (30 KB,
  100 % palette: per-instrument `{label, port, rangeLow, rangeHigh, techniques:[{key, label,
  channel, port?, cc0?, ks?, range}]}`), `motives/` (the shared library, D9 linked blocks).
- **Notation** `notation/` — `lib/` (layout 136 KB, render, glyphs.json with **9 glyph
  kinds and ONE clef = bass**, animobj, coords, static_page, splice, playability,
  extract_core), `registry/` (container.json = engraving data), `schema/` (IR v0 + JSON
  schema; **a gate on the file — an unknown kind deletes the page**), `app/notation.html`,
  `ir/` (pages). Parts are lane indices; `frameParts` renders any subset. **No transposition,
  no treble/alto clef, single staff per part, no chord columns** — the phase-2 gaps.
- **Print** `print/score/build.sh` + `tools/export_print.js` (Chrome headless PDF, vector,
  `--format tabloid-landscape`; A3 = one more format entry) · **video** `tools/export_video.js`
  (resvg, the repo's only dependency) · cover `print/cover/`.
- **Tools** `tools/` (100+): generic — `midi_out.js` (SMF writer), `model_bank.js`,
  `notate_section.js`, `ir_extract/validate`, `export_*`, `test_*`; the rest is tuba research.
  **Probes** `probes/*.ps1` = the winmm P/Invoke MIDI sender the AI drives (from #3's SB0).
- **Docs kit** copied here: `AI_METHODOLOGY`, `SESSION_HYGIENE`, `.claude/commands/
  {checkpoint,postclear}`; from #3: `HOW_WE_WORK`, `SESSION_PROTOCOL`.

### Libraries on hand (from the manuals in #3 and the maps in #1/#2)

- **IRCAM Solo Instruments 2 (UVI):** flute in C, clarinet in B♭, violin/viola/cello (+ mute,
  lead-mute variants), tuba, harp, accordion, … — **no piccolo, no bass flute, no bass
  clarinet, no piano.** Channel-per-technique switching; overflow instance when > 16.
- **Xsample:** bass clarinet owned and deep-mapped (#3: CC0 articulation select, CC1 MW
  dynamics crossfade, CC68/24 legato→gliss, CC82 RR, ¼-tone bend); **Contemporary Solo
  Strings** used in #1 (CC0 articulations, 3 channel banks because CC state won't reset,
  gliss keyswitches B0/G#1/A1). The Xsample woodwinds catalog lists piccolo, alto and bass
  flute — ownership unknown.
- **Piano (#2):** 8Dio Steinway Grand (Kontakt, velocity, CC64); IRCAM Prepared Piano 2
  (harmonics with CC21 pitch shift, muted). Port `Piano1`, channels 1–5.

## §2 Resume Here

**Last session:** *2026-09-04, session 2 (the morning test → a full day), Claude Code / Fable 5.1* —
the drawer tested and extended (U1–U4), the ensemble balanced by measurement (0j, D13–D14), Reaper +
the samplers addressable as code (0k, D15), D16 tongue ram; RUNNING_LOG §40–64; one line each in §6.
- Session 1 (2026-09-03): the kit ported and proven (0a, 0b, 0g, 0i), the rack built (0e),
  D7–D12, the drawer built (1c) — §6.

**This session (2026-09-04 evening → night, session 3, Claude Code / Fable 5.1) — checkpointed mid-session:**
- **The drawer's takes in the repo (O v2):** `bank/panel_snapshots.json`, bucket `strikes`, through the
  panels' snapshot route; the browser's v1 takes migrated once; `×` deletes. 16 takes so far (four per
  strike, 00–04). SPACE belongs to the drawer while it is open (the score's select-blur rule had handed
  it to the transport). RUNNING_LOG §65–66.
- **D17 — the save system as ONE rule (PLAN 1b done):** every open through a working copy (autosave
  there, never the file) · Save / CTRL+S writes the file · Name version freezes `<name>-v<label>` ·
  Reload drops the unsaved edits · a `?` hint strip · `tools/unsaved_check.js` before every commit ·
  names may carry dots · a deleted remembered name binds nothing. Save as next / Variant / Restore are
  gone. Live on the composer's machine (server restarted, page reloaded). §67–68, §70.
- **Q v2:** `Insert @ 0.61 s (original)` writes a strike at its own time into whatever score is open;
  originals replaced only where they truly exist. §68.
- **The piece has a file:** `scores/piece-septet.json` — strikes #0–#4 orchestrated from the drawer
  (40 objects, 0.6–6.7 s); frozen as `-v1.1` (three strikes, built by the AI from `ScatteredStrikes01a-3`,
  CN-8, §69) and `-v1.2` (five strikes, the composer's own Name version).
- **`scores/` sorted:** `ScatteredStrikes01` = the piano reference (the raw 577-strike recording,
  restored); the hand-made copies deleted at the composer's word. §70–71.
- Sketch pad: CN-8 (the piece begins with the strikes); for piece #6, animated conductions.
  Penn State abstract done (§7).

**Next up:** the composer composes — strikes #5 onward into `piece-septet` from the drawer (`Insert @
original time` into the open piece; a take per strike; Name version at milestones), CN-5 → CN-6.
At his word: the drawer's next features (I double stops · K lock · M/N/P harmony collection = PLAN 1d)
or phase 0's remainder (0d the Xsample measurements · 0c.5–0c.8 · 0f · the 0h gate).

**NEXT STEPS · MODEL · CLEAR:**
1. ☑ 0a · 0b · 0e · 0g · 0i · 0j · 0k.1–0k.4 · 1b · 1c.1 · 1c.2 (+U1–U4, O v2, Q v2) DONE and pushed.
2. ► **The composer composes with the drawer into `piece-septet`** (any model; conversation first).
   Fix what blocks; file the rest as STRIKES_TOOL statuses (`built` → `seen by the composer` → `accepted`).
3. Then the composer's pick: the drawer's next features, or 0d / 0c on Fable with the bridge
   (every rack change is a job with a read-back; the samplers' setups are scripts).
4. 0k.5 continues only when something needs it (0c.7's curve slots, the next rack).

**Open at session end** *(2026-09-04 night, Fable — mid-session checkpoint, for an AI that has never
seen this conversation):*
- **Task and state:** session 3's build work is complete, verified and pushed; the composer is composing
  in the running app (his server on :5300, D17 live). Nothing is half-built.
- **Latest deliverable:** `scores/piece-septet.json` (+ `-v1.2`) and `bank/panel_snapshots.json`
  (16 takes), committed at this checkpoint. `reaper/septet_rack.rpp` as the composer saved it at 20:47
  (REC items rearranged, cursor moved — Reaper's own churn, no rack change intended) committed too.
- **Next concrete step:** `/postclear`, then ask the composer what he wants: keep composing (be ready to
  fix what blocks in the drawer), the drawer's next features, or 0d. Before any commit run
  `node tools/unsaved_check.js`, then stage `scores/piece-septet*.json` and `bank/panel_snapshots.json`
  if he has worked — the piece and the takes are committed at every wrap.
- **Resume reads:** `docs/PLANNER.md` NOW · `docs/NAMING.md` §1 (D17, the save rule) ·
  `docs/STRIKES_TOOL.md` O, Q, U · `RUNNING_LOG.md` §65–71 · journal §4 D17 · `docs/REAPER_CONTROL.md`
  only if the rack is touched.
- **How the AI works the app:** its Browser pane opens `http://localhost:5300/composer.html` on the
  composer's server (no Web MIDI; it never edits his scores). A change to the save code is verified on a
  throwaway server — `PORT=5301 node score/server.js`, test files `zz-ai-*`, deleted after. A server
  change needs the composer to restart `node score\server.js`; a page change needs a reload.
- **How to work the rack now:** `node tools/reaper_job.js heartbeat | tracks | fader | run …`
  (docs/REAPER_CONTROL.md, reaper/bridge/README.md); `jobs/peakwatch.lua` + a probe note = the
  proof for routing; `tools/uvi_state.js` for UVI; a Kontakt Lua script dropped by the composer
  for Kontakt. Never trust frozen meters before dumping mute / solo / routing (P10).
- **Pending the composer:** CN-2 (piccolo vs bass flute) — not blocking.
- **Deliberately uncommitted:** nothing — `git status` is clean after this checkpoint's commit
  (`scores/*-work.json` and `scores/versions/` are gitignored by design).

**Open questions:**
- **Q1 flute doubling instrument:** piccolo or bass flute — composer undecided; SI2 flute in C
  is the track's instrument until then.
- **Q5 print format:** #4's tabloid is 432 mm long, past A3's 420 mm. Plan for A3 landscape.
- **Q6 (new):** the violins' Bartók pizz has no sample at B♭6 (90); its true top is somewhere in
  79–89 — read from the Kontakt GUI when the range ledger is next touched. The cello's Senza
  Vibrato is 12 dB softer at B4 than at C3 — the composer's ear decides whether that matters.

**Blockers:** none.

## §3 Principles

*(Lessons never to repeat. Numbered, append-only. 1–7 inherited from #3/#4 with their
sources; verified here only when they bite.)*

1. **Check Reaper input monitoring before blaming the instrument** (#3 P1) — armed +
   input-assigned + MIDI flicker ≠ monitored; the silent killer.
2. **When a working reference exists, diff the files, don't iterate guesses** (#3 P2).
3. **The IR schema is a gate on the file** (#4) — a new overlay kind must enter
   `notation/schema` in the same commit or the page is rejected and deleted. Snapshot first.
4. **Never `git add -A`** (#4 D30) — two agents may share a tree; stage explicit paths.
5. **Only delete IDs you created in the same breath** (#4 sandbox lessons) — cleaning up
   "everything present" destroyed composer data twice.
6. **MIDI thru must never listen to the loopMIDI output ports** (#4) — they echo into a
   feedback storm.
7. **Schedule playback with a ~150 ms lead** (#4) so the first note never races the
   all-notes-off before it.
8. **Object ids are per save — never delete or replace by id alone** (this repo, 2026-09-03,
   RUNNING_LOG §39; P5's cousin). `wc-40` exists in every score; the first Replace-in-place
   deleted six unrelated objects from the score that happened to be open. Any tool that removes
   objects it did not create in the same breath must first prove the loaded save is the source
   (`pieceBase(sessionName) === source`) — and refuse otherwise.
9. **Verify against the composer's running server; never hold his port and never save from the
   AI's pane** (2026-09-03). The AI's browser pane has no Web MIDI and its autosave would write
   into whatever save is open — set the session to `untitled` before any Insert test, clean up,
   reload. A hidden pane never fires `requestAnimationFrame`: test scripts must not await one.
10. **When downstream meters freeze at identical values, dump mute / solo / routing first**
    (2026-09-04, RUNNING_LOG §59; P1's cousin). Six tests were read behind a muted folder parent
    before the state dump showed `REC mute 1`.
11. **Learn a plugin's vocabulary by diffing the GUI's change, not by guessing from strings**
    (2026-09-04, §59). The plugin binary said "Out 2"; the state the GUI wrote said
    `$Engine/Out 2`. One click by the composer and a diff settled an hour of hypotheses.

## §4 Decisions

*(Append-only: ID, date, decision, why, what was rejected.)*

- **D1** *(2026-09-03)* — **Base = piece #4's stack, ported by copy-forward of selected
  folders with the instrument palette rewritten.** *Why:* the composer just finished the
  tuba piece and will use "very similar structures"; #4's app is instrument-keyed already
  (its D8) and #3 proved heterogeneous tracks with per-library mechanisms. *Rejected:*
  clone-and-prune the tuba repo (857 commits of tuba research in every cold session's way);
  extracting a shared engine package now (right shape, wrong six weeks — after the septet).
- **D2** *(2026-09-03, composer)* — **Same delivery format as the tuba piece:** animated
  scrolling score with the same animated devices; a presentation score (video + print) for
  the submission; the performance score before rehearsals, **ported from the tuba modules
  once they exist there** ("I'll be finishing up the performance score parts in the tuba
  piece, and then we can port those over here when the time comes").
- **D3** *(2026-09-03, composer)* — **Three phases:** compose with the sample libraries and
  the composer score → notate as a separate phase (2a engine adaptation; **2b presentation
  score** = video for the submission + print score) → performance versions before
  rehearsals. **The notation layer is not needed to start composing, because of the IR
  layer** — but its infrastructure is carried over now (PLAN 0g) so nothing is lost.
- **D4** *(2026-09-03, composer)* — **The lab journal and the sketch pad are standing
  habits, unprompted.** `RUNNING_LOG.md` = decisions, comments, theory, philosophy, how a
  thing was made, dead ends, corrections — for a paper later; `COMPOSITION_NOTES.md` = the
  composer's musical ideas verbatim. Rules adopted from `live-electronics-engine`
  (CLAUDE.md § Standing practice). *Rejected:* one merged file — state and record would blur.
- **D5** *(2026-09-03)* — **Ports 5300 (score) / 4800 (sandbox)**, distinct from #4's
  5200/4700 and #3's 5100/4600, so the tuba repo's servers and this repo's can run together
  while the tuba performance modules are still being built.
- **D6** *(2026-09-03)* — **The flute player is ONE track; the instrument in hand
  (flute / piccolo / bass flute) is a switch on that track,** carried by the technique
  recipe (port/channel/range for MIDI now; clef + transposition for notation in phase 2).
  *Why:* a doubling modelled as three tracks would notate as three staves and break the
  one-player = one-lane reading the animated score depends on. *Reversible* if the sandbox
  shows the switch needs to be its own object.
- **D7** *(2026-09-03, composer)* — **Strings = Xsample Contemporary Solo Strings.** *Why
  (composer):* the quartet's work transfers — technique switching, the control channels
  "used effectively" there — and piece #3 re-examined the same Xsample controller model on
  the bass clarinet (CC0 preset select, MW dynamics, CC68/24 legato → gliss). *Rejected:*
  SI2 strings for uniformity — "I don't wanna lose any of that Xsample functionality."
  *Named residual risk, the composer's own:* **volume — "we just need to get the CC7 nailed
  down"** → PLAN 0d, a bounded measurement, not an open-ended survey.
- **D8** *(2026-09-03, composer)* — **Push automatically after every commit**, staging
  explicit paths only (piece #4's D30 adopted; the inherited "ask push now?" in
  HOW_WE_WORK / SESSION_PROTOCOL is superseded, noted in place).
- **D9** *(2026-09-03)* — **The IR contract, stated from the beginning.** The composer's
  understanding: *"the IR is the data layer created in the composition stage and then used
  for all the other layers, just converting the data."* The precise form, as piece #4 built
  it (verified in `notation/app/notation.html` `loadIr`, `tools/export_print.js` /
  `export_video.js` `--ir`, and ARCHITECTURE.md "everything draws from the IR"):
  1. **The composer-score save file (S1) is the ground truth of the composition** — curves
     and markers on instrument-keyed tracks, one timecode in seconds.
  2. **The IR is DERIVED from S1** by an extractor (`tools/notate_section.js` →
     `notation/lib/extract_core.js`): a classifier over rules turns S1 objects into semantic
     events / chunks / groups with provenance on every node; derived ids are deterministic
     functions of source ids; notational decisions attach as authored overlays that
     re-attach by id when the IR is regenerated; the continuous (envelopes, curves) is
     referenced, never copied.
  3. **The IR is then the single source for every downstream manifestation** — the
     animated notation score, the video, the print score, and the performance stands (a
     live view of the IR, per #4's architecture). Print vs video proved byte-identical in #4.
  4. So the IR is **created from the composition, not during it**, and is regenerable at
     any time because S1 stays live. Composing never waits on the IR; the IR never freezes
     the composition. This is what makes "notate as a separate phase" (D3) safe.
  5. **What must be true of S1 from the beginning** (the real "in there from the start"):
     instrument-keyed tracks (have) · a technique key on every sounding object (the recipe
     key = the IR's `technique`) · the flute's instrument-in-hand as track data (D6) ·
     stable, never-reused object ids (have) · **one fixed convention for which layer holds
     META shapes vs notes** (the tuba classifier had to absorb drift between scores) · the
     real-sounding-length rule per material (#4's D9: one-shots carry sample-true length)
     · group ids on gestures. **Proof, not assertion: PLAN 0i** runs the tuba extractor and
     validator on a small septet save.
  6. **What IS piece-specific in the pipeline:** the classifier rules and the class
     registry (`notation/registry/classes.json`; #4's trance-stream / density-cloud
     classes). Those get septet classes in phase 2a. The schema, validator, layout and
     renderers do not change for that.
- **D10** *(2026-09-03, composer)* — **The composer score's lane order is the standard
  orchestral score order, top to bottom: flute (with its doublings) · bass clarinet · piano ·
  violin 1 · violin 2 · viola · cello.** The composer: *"look at a standard orchestration for
  the score layout. We'll lay out the composer score the same. My guess is strings at the
  bottom, piano in the middle, flute on top. And then the others in between."* The standard
  (Adler, *The Study of Orchestration*; Gould, *Behind Bars*): woodwinds · brass · percussion ·
  harp and keyboards · voices · strings, high to low within a family — for these seven,
  exactly the guess (the bass clarinet takes the clarinet's place under the flute; a piccolo
  or bass flute stays on the flute's line, D6). The one other convention, piano at the
  bottom, belongs to chamber music with piano and strings alone (trio, quartet, quintet;
  *Pierrot Lunaire*'s own score puts the piano last); a mixed ensemble with winds reads in
  orchestral order today. **Verified in the running app:** the lanes already sit in this
  order (TRACKS as ported at 0b — RUNNING_LOG §14). *Consequence for phase 2:* the notation
  score, the print and the parts keep the same order; bracket groups winds / piano brace /
  strings (PLAN 2a).
- **D11** *(2026-09-03, composer)* — **Channel banks by EVENT CLASS, from the start, on every
  Kontakt / Xsample port** (bass clarinet, vn 1, vn 2, va, vc): **ch 1 MAIN** — plain notes,
  dynamics by velocity, articulation by the prelude's CC0, keyswitches; no continuous
  controller is ever written here — and **ch 2 / 3 / 4 CURVE A / B / C**, used round-robin
  for any event that carries a continuous controller (CC7 level, CC1 timbre dynamic, CC4 +
  pressure vibrato width, bend), each event writing its own start values in its prelude. The
  composer: *"there's going to be events that happen right after a crescendo much sooner
  than two seconds … a crescendo in the violin that goes to secco … the next event might
  come in in a hundred and fifty milliseconds … So probably better to continue using
  multiple channels."* Offered A (main + two curve channels), B (main + three), C (the
  quartet's literal main / CC7 / vibrato banks); the composer chose **B** ("b"). *Why:* #4's
  250 ms lead and 2 s restore are the cost of moving a controller on a channel where a note
  sounds; a channel that is never moved has no timing cost, so the main channel is free of
  the law entirely; the only collision left is two curve events on one channel inside the
  lead window, and three curve channels cover three of them — cheap insurance, a Kontakt slot
  costs RAM only. *Rejected:* one channel per CONTROLLER (the quartet's scheme), because a
  note that swells and changes its vibrato width at once is one note on one channel — the
  split must be by event class. Flute (UVI, channel = technique) is decided at 0c: curve
  copies of the curve-bearing techniques in the four free Fluteb slots, or the tuba law as
  it stands; piano main only. Vibrato found, not remembered: width = CC4 + channel pressure
  (which one Xsample obeys is 0d's to measure); molto vibrato is a preset (CC0 2 / 70) and
  lives on the main channel. RUNNING_LOG §15–16.
- **D12** *(2026-09-03, composer, over the requirements session — `docs/STRIKES_TOOL.md` R1–R6, L,
  S)* — **The strikes tool is ONE full-width drawer in the composer score, built on the
  three-list model.** Pitches (the harmony), onsets (the rhythmic positions) and players are three
  independent lists paired freely; "as played" is one pairing; voicing presets move octaves only;
  an articulation is a layer on a voice — the pitch stays the harmony's, the articulation's KIND
  (pitched / fixed-pitch / noise / multiphonic) decides whether a stand-in sounds. Ranges: the
  shuffle never produces a misfit, a hand choice folds by octave or is skipped. The 60 ms grouping
  is re-derived after every transform, never frozen. Duration and dynamics as played, each with a
  multiplier (and a flatten switch). The keyboard shows the ensemble's span with an `88` toggle.
  *Why:* the composer wanted to "place different notes to different instruments" by hand AND to
  shuffle; keeping the three lists independent makes every combination reachable without modes.
  *Rejected:* the v1 table panel (a note list with per-row menus — no picture of the harmony);
  a floating panel (too small for five columns — "full size drawer"); a four-way switch for the
  piano's role (replaced, on the composer's push, by per-note flags with quick buttons);
  freezing the redaction grouping at capture (the grouping must follow the transformed rhythm).
- **D13** *(2026-09-04, composer)* — **The ensemble balance anchors on the violins, by
  measurement.** One probe run (every instrument's plain technique × 3 pitches × velocity 127 /
  64, recorded on the REC folder), the loudest 400 ms K-weighted RMS per note, trims = the
  violins' level minus each instrument's; applied as Reaper track faders (flute −21 · bcl −9 ·
  pianos +7 · va −3.5 · vc −1 · vn 0) and recorded as `balanceDb` in the recipe. *Why:* the
  composer's ear ("flute sounds quite loud") wanted "a 127 flute the same perceived loudness as a
  127 violin", data-based; the violins as anchor keeps the mockup at a normal level. *Rejected:*
  anchoring on the quietest (the piano — everything −7…−28 dB); velocity scaling (changes the
  sample layer); CC7 offsets (the app pins CC7 = 127 per event, and CC7 is the dynamics channel);
  the tuba rule's sampler-master trims (GUI-only, no number in the file — amended for this rack).
- **D14** *(2026-09-04, composer: "B")* — **A strike articulation that needs its own loudness gets
  its own lane:** a separate sampler output into a child Reaper track with its own fader, fed by a
  post-FX pre-fader send of the plugin's outputs 3/4. The flute's Pizzicato part → UVI `Out 2` →
  `Flute strikes`; the bass clarinet's slap → a second Kontakt slot on [A] 5 → output st.2 →
  `BassCl strikes`; the recipe routes by channel. Measured: the tongue ram lands level with the
  Bartók pizz. *Rejected:* CC7 per technique (cuts only, eats the dynamics range, a stray note
  is loud).
- **D15** *(2026-09-04, composer: "lets do a comprehensive survey and find the best, fast and
  reliable and most functions")* — **Reaper and the samplers are handled as code, through our own
  bridge, not an MCP server.** A Lua loop inside Reaper (from `__startup.lua`) answers job files in
  ~30 ms with the whole ReaScript API; its runtime is machine-level so every project uses it; UVI's
  state is XML edited by `tools/uvi_state.js`; Kontakt's multi is built by scripts on the Kontakt
  Lua API (developer features on); host automation for CC7-free knobs when a static sampler knob
  is wanted; the composer's hands only for what none of these reach. *Why:* every rack change
  becomes a job with a read-back instead of a screenshot conversation; the same foundation
  serves the live-electronics project and the next piece. *Rejected:* the seven community MCP
  servers (the same bridge underneath, a Python stack and a fixed vocabulary each); computer-use
  as the primary path (slow, medium reliability).
- **D16** *(2026-09-04, composer)* — **The flute's SI2 Pizzicato sample stands in for the written
  TONGUE RAM** ("pizzicato sounds loud in sample, just note that we'll notate this as tongue
  ram"): `notate: "tongue ram"` on `flute.pizzicato` — the first technique → notation mapping
  field, read by the notation layer at 2a. The patch's own tongue-ram keyswitch is unverified.
- **D17** *(2026-09-04, composer: "It's a bit too complex for me … I do want some sort of auto save
  … I don't want to have it override … I want to be able to keep kind of a running version … give it
  a name … let's try it")* — **The save system: ONE rule for every score, piece or experiment.**
  Opening a score puts you in its working copy (`<name>-work`, gitignored; autosave writes there);
  the file changes only on Save (+ a silent snapshot); "Name version" saves the file and freezes
  `<name>-v<label>` (committed, never overwritten); "Reload" drops the working copy; the `piece-`
  prefix alone decides the menu (Piece / Experiments). Hints: a `?` strip in the app. Session end:
  `tools/unsaved_check.js` before the commit. *Why:* piece #4's D10 protected `piece-*` names only,
  so the experiments — where the composing actually happened — were autosaved in place, and the
  four verbs (Save · Save as next · Variant · Restore) could not be remembered between sessions.
  Reaper's model (the file only on Save, backups out of sight) is the precedent. *Rejected:* Word's
  AutoSave-into-the-file (the override the composer named); a numbering chain (`sNN`, load-bearing
  nowhere); two folders (one folder, one prefix, is the whole rule); a Restore menu (the snapshots
  stay as the AI's net). RUNNING_LOG §67–68.

## §5 Playbooks

- **Sound research (mapping a sample library):** piece #3's journal §5.1 — the escalation
  ladder (manual → forums → transcripts → frame analysis → hands-on probes → hacks) and the
  CC/control probe protocol with scope tags (`engine` / `group` / `patch`). Reuse as written.
- **Composer-score save files:** #4's `docs/SAVE_FILES.md` + `NAMING.md` (piece menu,
  working copies, "Save as next", variants, restore). Reuse as written once 0b lands.

---

**Verifying the composer app from the AI's browser pane (2026-09-03):** the composer runs
`node score\server.js` himself — open http://localhost:5300/composer.html with `preview_start
{url}`, never start a second server on 5300. Before any test that mutates objects: set
`Composer.sessionName = 'untitled'` (autosave skips it), clear `autoSaveTimer`, and remove the
test objects after; reload the page at the end. The pane has no Web MIDI (Hear must fail with a
status line, not an exception) and `requestAnimationFrame` never fires while it is hidden.

---

**Working the rack through the bridge (2026-09-04):** `node tools/reaper_job.js heartbeat` first
(alive? which project?). Read before writing (`tracks`, `chunk`). Write, then read back in the
same job. Prove routing with `jobs/peakwatch.lua` + a probe note (`probes/port_note_probe.ps1`),
never by ear over CRD. Sampler internals: UVI by `tools/uvi_state.js` (decode → edit → `--push`
→ read back; the output token is `$Engine/Out n`); Kontakt by a Lua script the composer drops on
the rack (`reaper/kontakt/*.lua`, a JSON read-back in `reaper/kontakt/out/`). After editing
`bridge.lua`: `node tools/reaper_job.js reload`. The composer's CTRL+S is the truth; the bridge
never saves unasked. Gotchas: the Bash tool rewrites `\n` and `\b` inside heredocs — put
patches in a script file; the AI's browser pane has no Web MIDI and never fires rAF while hidden.

## §6 Done

- 2026-09-03 — **0a** PM kit installed (journal, plan, planner, lab journal, sketch pad,
  methodology, protocol, hygiene, commands, gitignore, CLAUDE.md, README).
- 2026-09-03 — **0b** composer module ported from piece #4 and verified live: score app
  :5300 (seven instrument-keyed lanes + META), sandbox :4800, bank skeletons, the
  seven-instrument recipe skeleton (RUNNING_LOG §9).
- 2026-09-03 — **0g** the notation/IR stack ported byte-exact (97 files) and proven whole
  (RUNNING_LOG §12); **0i** the S1 → IR contract proven on a septet save, NAMING.md §2 (§13).
- 2026-09-03 — **0e** the rack: eight loopMIDI ports, `reaper/septet_rack.rpp`, every preset
  menu rostered with ranges in `sandbox/instruments.js`, "rack works" from the composer app (§35).
- 2026-09-03 — **1c.1** the scattered-strike database (`tools/strike_db.js`,
  `bank/scattered_strikes.json`, §36); **1c.2** the STRIKES drawer built and verified in the
  running app (§39) — `built`, awaiting the composer's listening pass.
- 2026-09-04 — **1c.2 U1–U4** the drawer's first feature update, verified (§64); the drawer full
  height + tab (§40).
- 2026-09-04 — **0j** the ensemble balance measured and applied (D13, D14; §41–47, §60–61);
  `bank/balance.json`, `bank/balance_fl_bcl.json`.
- 2026-09-04 — **0k.1–0k.4 + the foundation of 0k.5** the Reaper bridge, UVI as XML, Kontakt as
  Lua, the two strike lanes, `reaper/bridge/README.md` (D15; §48–63).

- 2026-09-04 — **the first piece file:** `scores/piece-septet.json` (+ `piece-septet-v1.1`), the
  three orchestrated strikes from the drawer, the raw piano chords removed (CN-8, RUNNING_LOG §69);
  **1b** the save system rebuilt as one rule (D17, §67–68); **1c.2** the drawer's takes in the repo
  (O v2, §65–66) and `Insert @ original time` (Q v2, §68).

## §7 Human Notes

*(The composer's own to-dos and reminders. Reviewed at every session end.)*

**Active:**
- Decide piccolo vs bass flute when the music asks (Q1); confirm that library is installed.
- **Test the STRIKES drawer with U1–U4** (reload the page; shift-click = solo; the slap plays the
  strike slot). Then say which next: the drawer's next features, or 0d / 0c.
- *(AI-added, the composer's standing reminder from the rack session:)* **check each instrument
  plugin's gain** (unity; preset FX such as the maximizer / tilt bypassed) whenever a Kontakt or
  UVI instrument is loaded or its preset changed — SAMPLER_QUIRKS.md has the rule.

- **Next piece (after the septet): the "Lake George" piece** — pairs: english horn/bassoon,
  horn/trumpet, cello/bass, + percussion; start with a morph section (composer, 2026-09-04;
  verbatim in COMPOSITION_NOTES). **Animated conductions** for its delicate, quiet material —
  a pinch → lift → open hand gesture, to be captured from video and re-animated in the score
  (composer, 2026-09-04 session 3; verbatim in COMPOSITION_NOTES).

**Completed:**
- ~~Penn State abstract (tuba repo), due Fri 4 Sept~~ — done (composer, 2026-09-04).
