# 2026-09-03 — session 1 (Claude Code / Fable 5.1)

## §1. The project opens: the call, the instrumentation, the lineage

The composer named the session *"Tempus Septet 2026"* and set the frame: *"I'll be
starting a new composition; the software will largely be based on the tuba piece but may
reference the other repos; the call is in this repo in the docs folder; it will be for
flute (piccolo/bass flute), bass clarinet, piano, violin 1, violin 2, viola, cello."* —
the full septet the call allows. First instruction: *"don't port or do anything yet, but be
ready to discuss a plan."*

The call (`docs/Tempus-Lab2026_Application_English.pdf`, read in full): TEMPUS LAB 2026,
Ensemble Tempus Konnex, Leipzig. Deadline 2026-10-15 23:59 CET. Max 12 min. PDF score,
max DIN A3. €25 fee. Concerts 26/27/28 Nov 2026; if selected, score + parts free of charge
4 weeks before. Instrument list: flute (incl. piccolo, alto, bass), clarinet (incl. bass),
piano, vn I, vn II, va, vc — *"compositions featuring instruments not listed above will
not be considered."* (Flag: electronics are not listed. Journal Q3.)

## §2. The survey — what the tuba stack is and how tuba-bound it is (measured, not inferred)

Read-only pass over #4 (`for_seven_tubas`, 857 commits, last commit 2026-09-03), #3 (49
commits, paused 2026-08-10 at the first score objects), #2 (237 commits, composition
complete, perf-score pipeline), #1 (deployed at justinwenloyang.com). Method: docs first
(CLAUDE.md, journals §1/§2, PLAN, ARCHITECTURE), then targeted greps — no whole-file reads
of code.

**The tuba-coupling count** (`grep -ic tuba`, source files only):

| file | mentions | what they are |
|---|---|---|
| `sandbox/instruments.js` | 93 | the palette itself — 100 % rewrite |
| `score/public/composer.html` | 46 | TRACKS array (10), lane labels, a select, 2 `INSTRUMENTS.tuba1`, 1 port arithmetic |
| `tools/pitch_beat.js` | 24 | tuba-piece research (beating pairs) — not ported |
| `score/public/clusterview.html` | 13 | research view — port, low priority |
| `notation/lib/layout.js` | 2 | comments |
| `notation/registry/container.json` | 2 | notes |
| `score/server.js` | 1 | the banner comment |

Conclusion: **the engine is instrument-agnostic by construction; the palette is the whole
coupling.** Sizes for scale: composer.html 810 KB; server.js 54 KB, zero dependencies;
notation `layout.js` 136 KB; `glyphs.json` holds **9 glyph kinds and exactly one clef
(bass)**; `grep -ril treble notation/` → nothing. So notation's multi-instrument gaps
(clefs, transposition, piano grand staff, chord columns) are real and are phase-2 work.

**Rejected framing, for the record:** "port the notation engine and adapt it now." The
composer's own reasoning settled it (§3 below): the IR layer decouples composing from
notation, so the engine is carried over untouched and adapted when a real page exists.

## §3. The composer's plan, in his words (dictated; cleaned from speech-to-text, content untouched)

> *"As a general rule, I don't want to get too bogged down in technical details of porting
> and code and such, but I want to do a good, solid job and not leave out things now that
> might bite later. So, essentially, I just finished the tuba piece, so I'll be using very
> similar structures. So I think the first step is to figure out what it takes to bring the
> composer module over — how to get a clean port that preserves all the functionality —
> and then just an evaluation of if that's enough for now to get started, or do we really
> need to consider the notation layer from the start. I think not, probably, because of the
> IR layer. This will be essentially the same format as the tuba score; it will still be an
> animated score using the similar animated devices. And I'll be finishing up the
> performance score parts in the tuba piece, and then we can port those over here when the
> time comes."*

> *"The strings, the samples, and everything, and how to work with the sample libraries are
> done in the string quartet piece. And the piano is the same thing — library, everything
> established in the piano-percussion piece. So I want to start laying out a plan of porting
> the composer module and, of course, all the IR and whatever infrastructure we need, and
> setting up the Reaper session and establishing all the MIDI rules and how to achieve
> different articulations and effects using the sample libraries."*

> *"Ideally, I would compose a piece with the sample libraries and the composer score, and
> then we would notate the piece like I did with the tuba piece in a separate phase, and
> then we would prepare the performance versions in a third phase. And as part of the
> notate phase there's a phase 2b, the presentation score — a video for the submission and
> also a print score — and then the performance score before rehearsals begin. But the tuba
> modules should be in place by then, so we'd probably just use the exact same one."*

> *"One thing to think about is I may just use the IRCAM Solo Instruments 2 for the strings.
> I may not; it depends on the functionality, so we'll do a compare. The string quartet was
> done with Xsample, but I think it was a bit idiosyncratic. Also look in the bass clarinet
> harp piece, because we used Xsample bass clarinet and I think worked out some more of how
> to use the control channels effectively with Xsample. It might be easier to deal with
> Xsample; I just need to compare the functionality with the IRCAM to see if one is better
> than the other. It might be easier to work all in IRCAM, but I don't wanna lose any of
> that Xsample functionality for the strings."*

Recorded as D2 (format), D3 (phases) and PLAN 0d (the strings compare).

## §4. Decisions D1–D6 and what was rejected (see journal §4 for the canonical text)

- **Seeding method.** Three options were put: (a) clone-and-prune the tuba repo (the string
  quartet's own IV.3 recipe), (b) copy-forward selected folders with the palette rewritten
  (how #4 was made from #3, its D1), (c) extract a shared engine package. **(b) chosen.**
  (a) rejected because 528 JSON research files and 84 tuba docs would sit in every cold
  session's path (#3's D5 minimal-reading principle); (c) rejected for the calendar — six
  weeks to the deadline — not on merit; it returns after the septet.
- **Ports 5300/4800** so the tuba servers (5200/4700) keep running while the performance
  modules are built there.
- **The flute doubling = one track with an instrument switch** (D6). The alternative —
  three tracks — was rejected because the animated score reads one lane per player, and a
  player cannot be three lanes.

## §5. Libraries on hand — facts from the manuals, not memory

- SI2 manual (`#3/docs/manuals/extracted/IRCAM_Solo_Instruments_2_manual.txt`), Instrument
  List pp. 51–62: **FLUTE in C** (aeolian … flatterzunge … jet-whistle, key-click, play-and-
  sing, ~30 techniques), **CLARINET in B♭**, **VIOLIN / VIOLA / VIOLONCELLO** each with
  mute and lead-mute variants, ~40 techniques each incl. transitions (ordinario-to-sul-
  ponticello, ordinario-to-tremolo, pressured-to-ordinario), artificial harmonics,
  behind-the-bridge, col legno battuto/tratto, pizzicato-bartok, sul-ponticello-tremolo,
  trills. **No piccolo, no bass flute, no bass clarinet, no piano in SI2.** Parts "written
  at actual pitch" — the library plays sounding pitch; transposition is ours.
- Xsample: the woodwinds catalog text lists **Piccolo (348 samples), Alto Flute (493), Bass
  Flute (425)** — the catalog, not proof of ownership. Bass clarinet owned and deep-mapped
  in #3 (CC0 presets 1–88; CC1 MW crossfade *"like an actual player doing a crescendo"*;
  CC68/24 legato → glissando; CC82 round-robin; quarter-tone bend range).
- #1 used **X-Sample Contemporary Solo Strings**: CC0 articulations 89 senza vib, 95 pizz,
  71 pizz open (one-shot), 97 Bartók (one-shot), plus molto-vib and behind-the-bridge
  values; **12 MIDI channels in 3 banks (base/vibrato/volume) because CC120/123 did not
  reliably reset CC state** — a crescendo ending at CC7=127 left the channel loud. Gliss
  keyswitches B0 (mode) / G#1 (down) / A1 (up); CC68/24 legato "to investigate".
- #2 piano: **8Dio Steinway Grand** (velocity, CC64, range 21–108, port `Piano1` ch 1) and
  **IRCAM Prepared Piano 2** (harmonics ch 3/4 with CC21 pitch shift, 19.048 cents per
  step, 85 ms CC lead; muted ch 5).

Open (journal Q1/Q2): which flute-family library is installed; strings library verdict.

## §6. Flags raised, none resolved

1. **Electronics.** The call lists instruments only. If the live-electronics engine is to
   enter this piece, ask `scores@tempus-konnex.com` before designing around it.
2. **Page size.** #4 prints tabloid (279 × 432 mm); A3 is 297 × 420 mm — tabloid's long
   side is 12 mm over. Plan for A3 landscape (a format entry in `export_print.js`).
3. **Duration.** The tuba piece ran 12:29; this one is capped at 12:00.
4. **Penn State** (tuba repo): abstract hosting + form due Fri 2026-09-04, 11:59 pm ET.

## §7. The kit installed; what was deliberately not done

Installed: CLAUDE.md, README, journal, PLAN, PLANNER, this log, COMPOSITION_NOTES, NITS,
AI_METHODOLOGY + SESSION_HYGIENE (copied from #4, provenance note prepended), HOW_WE_WORK +
SESSION_PROTOCOL (copied from #3, one line changed: explicit staging instead of `git add -A`),
`.claude/commands/{checkpoint,postclear}` (from #4; the push line now follows this repo's
policy), `.gitignore` (from #4, trimmed). **No code copied** — PLAN 0b waits for the go.
The `live-electronics-engine` folder was granted as an additional working directory.

## §8. The composer's four answers, and the IR question settled

**The IR, in the composer's words:** *"I want to clarify one thing about the IR layer. I
was under the impression that this was basically the peak — this was the data layer that
would be created in the composition stage and then be used for all the other layers, just
converting the data. So I want to make sure that's understood and that's in there from the
beginning — or correct me if I'm misunderstanding something."*

**The answer, checked against the tuba repo rather than remembered:** half right, and the
half that matters. The IR IS the single source for every downstream score — the animated
notation app loads the IR first (`notation.html` `loadIr`), then fetches the save named in
`ir.source.score` only for the continuous data the IR references; print and video take
`--ir` and nothing else; #4's ARCHITECTURE.md line 354: *"everything draws from the IR
(save → IR → print / video / stands — one source, proven byte-identical for print vs
video)."* But it is **not created in the composition stage**: it is *derived* from the
composer save by the extractor (`notate_section.js` → `extract_core.js`), with provenance
on every node, deterministic derived ids, and authored overlays that re-attach by id, so
it can be regenerated whenever the save moves. The composer save (S1) stays the ground
truth of the composition. Consequence: composing never waits on the IR, and "in there from
the beginning" means the *save's shape* must carry what extraction needs — recorded as D9
with the seven-point list, and PLAN 0i proves it by running the extractor on a septet
test save instead of trusting the list. *Rejected framing:* "author the IR during
composition" — it would create a second copy of the composition to keep in sync, which is
exactly what #4's "reference, don't copy" law forbids.

**The flutes:** *"I'm not sure yet if I'm using piccolo or bass flute, but you're right,
it's on the same track in the score, so we'll just make those adjustments if the time
comes."* → CN-2; PLAN 0c.1 reworded; Q1 narrowed to "which one, and is its library
installed."

**Strings:** *"Let's go with the Xsample for the strings. I believe we've overcome most of
the hurdles with the bass clarinet, or at least re-examined them, so I probably shouldn't
have as much anxiety about that. We know how to switch techniques; we have a grasp on the
control channels, and a lot of them were used in the string quartet effectively. I think we
have to get some of the volume switching right — I guess I have a little bit of anxiety. I
don't want to get too bogged down in that, but we'll cross that when we get there. We just
need to get the CC7 nailed down."* → D7. The anxiety is well placed and bounded: #3's
Xsample findings are about CC1 (the MW crossfade) — a grep of the bass clarinet map and
the quirks ledger finds **no CC7 measurement on Xsample at all**; the quartet's three
channel banks exist because CC7 state persisted and CC120/123 did not reset it. So PLAN 0d
is repurposed from "library compare" to "CC7 → dB measured with #4's probe (it takes port
and channel as parameters) + the state rule verified + a one-page dynamics recipe." Small,
measurable, and it closes the one thing the quartet never closed.

**Electronics:** *"No live electronics in this piece. That was just to get you access to
some of the journaling techniques. I don't think we'll use any of the code from that
repo."* → Q3 closed; CLAUDE.md and the parking lot say so.

**Push:** *"Q4: go ahead and push after every commit."* → D8; CLAUDE.md, the checkpoint
command and the inherited HOW_WE_WORK / SESSION_PROTOCOL lines amended in place.
